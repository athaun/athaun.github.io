            <p><strong>Human Centered Software Design</strong></p>
            <p>As a software developer and student of software development majoring in computer science, I am always
                learning new things about the field. I have been a hobbyist of programming and some of the many
                accompanying disciplines for over five years; I have been conducting research in computational virology
                for almost three and have been working professionally for under a year. I have been a self-taught
                student of programming for years and recently started learning under the tutelage of professors in the
                university environment. I have worked on my own, for an employer, for an advisor, in pairs, in a group
                and as leader of a team. When designing software, I believe that there are three critical facets to
                consider, these involve considering the planned users, users&rsquo; access, and the design of the
                software.</p>
            <p><strong>Users of software</strong></p>
            <p>I believe it is important to consider the people who will be using the software I develop. A website or
                program can be intended for a specific knowledgeable userbase or for a very general audience. How
                specific the userbase is determines what features are included, what interfaces are made available and
                how. While the more general userbases may require a system with less technical jargon, fewer options to
                get lost in, etc. Each kind of user has different expectations when it comes to how they will use the
                software and it isn&rsquo;t possible to develop for every audience.</p>
            <p>For example, in web development, it is imperative to keep screen reader usage in mind, to incorporate alt
                text and navigation shortcuts that make the user&rsquo;s experience as seamless as possible. In many
                hobby projects, including in some of my own past websites, accessibility for audiences with disabilities
                is often ignored. I believe this should change even though it requires effort most people will never
                realize has taken place.</p>
            <p><strong>User Access</strong></p>
            <p>Software wields power, and with that power concerns over who has access to what arise. When I develop
                software, I must consider who should be allowed to have access to the program itself and more
                importantly, to its source. I have been significantly influenced by the <a
                    href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/greve-clown.en.html#:~:text=The%20philosophy%20of%20the%20GNU,this%20freedom%20from%20anyone%20else.">GNU
                    &ldquo;free as in freedom&rdquo; philosophy</a> of development, where anybody should have access to
                a software&rsquo;s source code. This philosophy of freely open-sourced code has led to great inventions
                like Linux which has become the backbone of the internet as we know it. With &ldquo;free as in
                freedom,&rdquo; it does not follow that software adhering to the principle is monetarily free, but that
                the users possess the liberty to view and modify the source code of their software.</p>
            <p>Although I have been influenced by the GNU philosophy, I don&rsquo;t fully believe it is reasonable for
                every piece of software to allow its users this kind of freedom. It is important for authors to have the
                option to keep their code as a proprietary creation. A lot of effort goes into designing and development
                of software, so it is the author&rsquo;s prerogative to decide the user&rsquo;s level of access. In
                certain cases, a client or employer may require that the source be closed and that should be respected.
                The decision of how accessible to make the source of a program can&rsquo;t be black and white.</p>
            <p><strong>Design of software</strong></p>
            <p>One thing I know with certainty is that nobody knows everything there is to know about software
                development. It is a constantly shifting field of new languages, frameworks, design paradigms and
                opinions every day. With this in mind, I believe it is silly to exclusively adhere to a single design
                paradigm. Some people claim nothing can be achieved via object-oriented programming and that
                data-oriented design is the only way to write code while some people claim the opposite. There are
                positive aspects to both; in different ways, they both improve the organization of code, however if
                someone&rsquo;s code contains a class name like &ldquo;FactoryBeanConstructerBuilderNode,&rdquo; then
                something somewhere has gone terribly wrong.</p>
            <p>When writing software, there are a few aspects that are very important to me: readability, efficiency and
                maintainability. Rather than exclusively applying a single design paradigm, I think that software should
                be designed for its purpose&mdash;where the goal is not to fit into a <em>perfect paradigm</em> but to
                improve efficiency and to make it as easy as possible for the humans who are reading it to do so,
                improving maintainability.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p>I am committed to always learning and improving my skills. I believe in considering the planned users of
                my software, their access to it, and the overall design of the software. I strive to make my software
                accessible and easy to use for all intended audiences, and to balance the need for
                &ldquo;free&rdquo;/open-source code with the rights of authors to control access to their work. In my
                design decisions, I consider the principles of readability, efficiency and maintainability. I also
                believe in staying open-minded to new design paradigms while avoiding overly complex solutions. My goal
                is to create high-quality software that meets the needs of its users and clients while considering the
                author and future maintainers.</p>
